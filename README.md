Plik "PROJECT REPORT" to sprawozdanie z ca≈Çego projektu. 

## Project Description
The task was to create a tic-tac-toe game using the minimax algorithm. I used the SFML library to create the GUI.

## Features
The game allows the user to choose the size of the board from 3x3 to 10x10, and also lets the user choose who goes first - the computer or the user.

## Implementation
I used the minimax algorithm to develop the game logic. The game uses the SFML library for the graphical user interface, and I used object-oriented programming concepts to develop the game.

## How to Use?
To use the program, simply download the code and compile it using your preferred C++ compiler. Then run the executable file and start playing the game.

## Requirements
To run the program, you will need the SFML library installed on your system. You can download the library from the official website and install it on your computer. To use the SFML library, you need to specify the path to the library in Visual Studio.  
## Youtube video
Here is the link to the YouTube video that demonstrates how the program works. [YT link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK83I2n2WDU&ab_channel=MarcinCichocki)
## Conclusion
I enjoyed developing this project, and it was a great opportunity to practice my programming skills. I hope you find this tic-tac-toe game fun and enjoyable to play.
